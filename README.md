# ViPER4Android FX 2.7
This module is a downloader and more for V4A 2.7. This includes profile converter and vdcs from original v4a (copied to DDC-Orig so you can cherry pick what you want)
This is a much needed update to the old v4a app that fixed all of the app bugs in previous version.
Due to this, there's no need for Audio Compatibility Patch or any other hacky workarounds - the app handles all of that now
